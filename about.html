                    <p><strong>Vision Statement</strong> To provide members/clients with a proper workout which will
                        help their bodies
                        to change so they can reach their fitness goals, as well as educate them so they can achieve
                        their long-term goals without injury. </p>
                    <p><strong>Mission Statement</strong> To help members/clients achieve their fitness goals long term
                        by
                        transitioning from personal training to group fitness and referring clients. Group classes are
                        set up to achieve everything the body needs to change and reach oneâ€™s goals. If members cannot
                        come at one particular time slot throughout the week, they can use the color coordinated
                        schedule to help them achieve their goals. </p>
                    <p class="h3">No Yearly Fees or Cancellation Fees</p>
